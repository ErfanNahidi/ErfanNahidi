## 🔧 Core Skills

### 🛡️ Security & Systems
- **Linux & Bash**: hardening (systemd, journald, ufw/iptables), automation scripts for SOC triage  
- **SOC toolchain**: OSSEC, Snort, Suricata; log parsing with Python  
- **Network forensics**: Wireshark, tcpdump; Network+ & CCNA & CEH certified insights  
- **VPN & firewall configs**: OpenVPN setups, iptables rulesets, proxy chaining  

### 🔐 Encryption & Cryptography
- **Symmetric & Asymmetric**: AES, RSA basics, elliptic curves overview  
- **Hash functions**: SHA‑2/3, HMAC constructions  
- **Practical challenges**: designed & solved CTF crypto puzzles (weekend labs)  
- **Secure protocols**: TLS handshake analysis, custom key‑exchange scripting  

### 💣 Malware & Reverse Engineering
- **Static & dynamic analysis**: Ghidra, radare2, objdump, strace  
- **IOC & YARA**: rule writing, sandbox tracing of Linux malware samples  
- **Shellcode unpacking**: simple packer reversal, string de‑obfuscation  
- **Custom tooling**: Python scripts for callback/C2 detection  

### 🔍 Vulnerability Research (WIP)
- **Web**: manual SQL injection, XSS, CSRF testing  
- **Deserialization**: insecure Python/Java patterns  
- **Memory exploits**: buffer overflow basics, format‑string probes  
- **Recon & OSINT**: automated metadata harvesting, custom scrapers  

### 🛠️ Engineering & Tool Development
- **Python**: CLI scanners, fuzzers, FastAPI Auth System (JWT + bcrypt)  
- **C/C++**: memory interrogation tools, basic exploit POCs  
- **SQLite**: secure schema design; built “SQLite Login Lab” for injection practice  
- **Data Science**: Pandas, Scikit‑learn, ARIMA, Prophet—applied to security analytics
